# YelpCamp website notes

This repository contains my notes which were taken while creating YelpCamp website which was taught in Udemy course by colt steele https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp and https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp

I tried to write everything in the way a novice learner (such as myself) would understand.

Please bear in mind that the notes here do not cover everything, are not 100% complete, and are written based on the information from Udemy courses. So if you need something more comprehensive, please see other documentation online (MDN, W3, etc).
